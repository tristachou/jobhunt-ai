export const DEMO_COVER_MD = `Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Frontend Engineer position at NovaPay. With five years of experience building high-performance web applications in TypeScript and React, I am excited by the opportunity to work on infrastructure that millions of people rely on every day.

In my current role at DesignFlow, I led a full migration of our legacy dashboard to React 18, reducing bundle size by 42% and cutting page load time by nearly two seconds. I also built a real-time transaction monitoring UI that is now used by over 2,000 merchants — a project that required close collaboration between frontend, backend, and product teams.

What draws me to NovaPay specifically is your commitment to developer experience and the scale of problems you are solving. I believe my background in both product-facing features and internal tooling would let me contribute meaningfully from day one.

I would love to discuss how my experience aligns with what the team is building. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Warm regards,
Jordan Avery
